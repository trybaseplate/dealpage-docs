    <Tip> Get access to the DealPage Sandbox environment to test the platform's capabilities with synthetic data! Reach out to us at founders@dealpage.ai to get started today. </Tip>

    ## Account Setup
    You should have received an email with a link to set up your account after your demo. If you haven't received it, please contact us! You can easily add teammates to your account by clicking the Gear icon next to your organization logo (top left corner)

    ## 1. Connect integrations

    Head to the [Integrations](https://app.dealpage.ai/integrations) tab and connect any apps you use. If you connect your CRM, a few recent deals will be imported.

    <Tip> Customer favorites are the Slack, Drive, Chrome, and Salesforce integrations (Only on Team and Business Plans). </Tip>

    ## 2. Build Your Knowledge Base
    <img src="/images/designed-library.png" alt="Library" />

    Upload any docs you'd like to be sources to your [Knowledge Base](/usage/knowledge-base).

    **Great places to start**:
    1. Documentation (URL Import)
    2. Security Policies
    3. Sales Collateral
    4. Proposals

    There are no limitations to what you can upload here - our models work great even with images, .pptx, and .xlsx. Everything uploaded to the content library
    is automatically searchable and used by the AI.

    ## 3. Test Knowledge Base Search

    ## 4. Create a Deal (Team Plan +)
    <img src="/images/deals.png" alt="Deals" />

    Go to the [Deals](/usage/deals) tab. If you connected your CRM in step 1 you might already see some deals here. If not click New Deal.
    You can sync all details from a Deal in Hubspot or Salesforce Opportunity with one click.

    ## 5. Kick off a Workflow (Team Plan +)
    <img src="/images/deal-home.png" alt="Deal Home" />
    You can use this Deal as a home base for your sales activities with this account. Add context like your meeting transcripts, chat with Paige to answer questions, or start a workflow using the Action Buttons.

    <Tip> Test out the Slack bot! </Tip>
