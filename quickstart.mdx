    ## Connect integrations

        Head to the [Integrations](/concepts/integrations) tab and connect any apps you use. If you connect your CRM, a few recent deals will be imported.

        **We highly, highly recommend adding the Slack integration, Chrome Extension, Gmail Integration, and a CRM integration.**

    ## Upload Content to Knowledge Base
        <img src="/images/library.png" alt="content" />

        Upload a few docs to your [Knowledge Base](/concepts/knowledge-base) in the Content Library tab. If you connected a Drive, Notion, or Confluence integration you can
        directly import from those sources. These can be existing documentation, collateral, proposals, or any document you want the AI to access. Everything uploaded to the content library
        is automatically searchable and used by the AI. You can restrict access further by making the document "Invite only". Users who
        do not have access will not see it used as a source by the AI.

    ## Create a deal
        <img src="/images/deals.png" alt="Deal" />

        Go to the [Deals](/concepts/deals) tab. If you connected your CRM you might already see some deals here. If not click New in the top right or New Deal in the left sidebar and create a deal.
        Just enter the domain and we'll enrich the client information, or import one from Hubspot or Salesforce.

## Done!

        You're all set! You can now start using the AI to help you with your deals. Ask a question in the chat by pressing "cmd/ctrl + k". The AI will use the content library or information from your deal to find the best answer for you.

        You can also kick off workflows from inside the deal. See the [Workflows](/concepts/workflows) sections for more info.
