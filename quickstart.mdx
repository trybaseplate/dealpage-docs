## Connect integrations

Head to the Integrations tab and connect any apps you use. If you connect your CRM, a few recent deals will be imported.

## Configure workspace settings

Go to the Settings tab and configure your workspace. These settings determine how the interactive viewer will look when you share it.
You can enable/disable the AI chatbot or the human chat inbox. You can also select which sources the bot has access to when a user asks a question.

## Upload to Knowledge Base

Upload a few docs to your knowledge base in the Content Library tab. If you connected a Drive, Notion, or Confluence integration you can
directly import from those sources. These can be existing collateral, proposals, or any document you want the AI to access. Everything uploaded to the content library
is automatically searchable and used by the AI. You can restrict access further by making the document "Invite only". Users who
do not have access will not see it used as a source by the AI.

## Create a deal

Go to the Deals tab. If you connected your CRM you might already see some deals here. If not click New in the top right or New Deal in the left sidebar and create a deal.
Just enter the domain and we'll enrich the client information, or import one from Hubspot or Salesforce.

## Share content from your knowledge base

Click on the "Share content" action button and select a document from your content library to share.
It will be copied over to the deal, where you can then configure the sharing settings and get a shareable link.

That's it! If you wan't notifications for when someone views the document, you can configure it back in the Settings tab.
The analytics will be tracked within the deal and the copy of the document. For information on other workflows, refer to the guide on [workflows](/concepts/workflows)
