## CRM Integrations

Link DealPage to your CRM to automatically sync information from your deals including emails, notes, and documents. These items will be fully searchable in the context of a deal.
Deals linked to a CRM are refreshed automatically daily. When new deals are created in your CRM, they will automatically be created in DealPage.

## Messaging Integrations

You can chat with DealPage and send messages using our Messaging Integrations.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
        title="Slack"
        icon="slack"
    >
    Add Paige to your Slack workspace to get questions answered directly in Slack. Or tag Paige in a channel for her to respond there.
You can also add verified answers directly from Slack responses.

Another common use case is linking a deal in DealPage to a Slack channel where you may be providing
support for your customer. You can link a deal to a channel in the deal's home page. When you ask Paige a question in the linked channel,
she will have access to any documents inside the deal as well.
