DealPage integrates with your business apps to make set up and workflows even easier.

## Hubspot and Salesforce

Link DealPage to your CRM to automatically sync information from your deals including emails, notes, and documents. These items will be fully searchable in the context of a deal.
Deals linked to a CRM are refreshed automatically daily. When new deals are created in your CRM, they will automatically be created in DealPage.

## Gmail

Link your inbox to use the auto email drafting workflow and send email directly in DealPage.
Our Chrome extension also allows auto email drafting if Gmail is connected. More on email drafting in [workflows](/concepts/workflows).

## Google Drive, Notion, Confluence

Import pages and files directly from Drive, Notion or Confluence. You can import documents to your knowledge base as content or directly to a deal to be used as shared collateral.

## Slack

Add Paige to your Slack workspace to get questions answered directly in Slack. Or tag Paige in a channel for her to respond there.
You can also add verified answers directly from Slack responses.

Another common use case is linking a deal in DealPage to a Slack channel where you may be providing
support for your customer. You can link a deal to a channel in the deal's home page. When you ask Paige a question in the linked channel,
she will have access to any documents inside the deal as well.
