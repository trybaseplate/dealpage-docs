## Overview
Paige is your team’s personalized AI Assistant. She uses resources in your DealPage Knowledge Base and your connected tools like a CRM, email, or meeting transcripts to provide instant, accurate, and definitive answers to your questions.

Leveraging our embedding and multi-step retrieval architecture, your team can build a SOTA, secure, and scaleable internal search engine in a few clicks. Rather than clicking through multiple apps, files, or messages to find what you need, just ask Paige through Slack, Chrome, or the DealPage web app.

She’ll respond instantly with relevant links and an answer. She can format her answer in any way you need, regardless of if you need an email, set of bullet points, or a markdown table.
