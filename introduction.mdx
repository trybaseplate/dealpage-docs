## What is DealPage?
DealPage is an AI platform designed to help technical sales teams close more deals faster and create happier buyers. We do this by connecting cutting-edge AI Agents together with your technical documentation, sales content, and customer communication.

Our AI Assistant, Paige, can help you answer technical questions from non-technical teammates, instantly respond to customer questions, navigate sales content, and answer questions about your accounts. These capabilities are enhanced by our document creation and sharing tools, which help you share infromation more effectively than ever before.
