## CRM Integrations

Link DealPage to your CRM to automatically sync information from your deals including emails, notes, and documents. These items will be fully searchable in the context of a deal.
Deals linked to a CRM are refreshed automatically daily. When new deals are created in your CRM, they will automatically be created in DealPage.
