    <Tip> Get access to the DealPage Sandbox environment to test the platform's capabilities with synthetic data. Reach out to us at founders@dealpage.ai to get started today. </Tip>

    The fastest way to get started is using the Onboarding Modal (click Help at the bottom left of the screen to open if you've already dismissed). Here's a quick guide to get you started.

    ## 1. Connect integrations
    Connect DealPage to your most important data sources. We highly recommend connecting at least a CRM and Slack during this stage.

    You can also head to the [Integrations](https://app.dealpage.ai/settings/integrations) tab to connect other apps.

    ## 2. Import Content
    Once you've connected your tools, select which content you'd like to import. If you don't want to connect DealPage to any tools, you can create Deals and upload content to your Knowledge Base manually.

    ## 3. Start a Chat

    Start a chat. You can use one of the example prompts or get creative and ask your own. Paige will use the Deals and Content you've imported to answer your questions.

    <Tip> You can also try chatting with the Slack bot! </Tip>
