### Knowledge Base Question Answering
You can ask Paige questions about your products, competitors, and more. She will respond with the most relevant information from your knowledge base.
E.g. What data centers do we use to serve European customers?

### Deal Question Answering
You can ask Paige questions about the deal, like who the decision maker is, what the timeline is, and more. She will respond with the most relevant information from your CRM, email, meeting transcripts, and other connected tools.
E.g. What did we demo to close our **deal with Acme Corp**?

### Document Selection
You can ask Paige to find links to documents, like a case study, pitch deck, or contract. She will respond with links to the most relevant documents from your knowledge base.
E.g. Can you **find the document** detailing use cases of our Slack bot?

### Deal Selection
Find deals based on a flexible set of criteria like recency, deal size, customer description, revenue, number of employees, etc.
E.g. What are the top 10 biggest deals we've worked on with healthcare customers?

## Use Cases
Use cases are flexible and can be tailored to your specific needs. Paige can do whatever you ask as long as your Knowledge Base and Deals include the information she needs. Here are some common use cases:

### Pipeline Reviews
Ask Paige to help you understand your current deals, risks, and opportunities. She can help you identify gaps in your pipeline, prioritize deals, and more.

E.g. "Take our top 10 in-progress deals by revenue and summarize the deals, with specific mentions of their use cases and pain points, along with any potential blockers"

### Product Gap Analysis
Ask Paige to help you understand where your product is falling short. She can help you identify gaps in your product, prioritize features, and more.

E.g. "Search the last 5 deals we lost and identify product gaps in the meeting transcripts. Then categorize them and output them in a table along with the amount of revenue affected. After identifying gaps, look in our product roadmap to see if we have an estimated delivery date for those features."

### Meeting Prep
Ask Paige to help prep for meetings and calls. She can help you efficiently learn from previous opportunities (or the current one).

E.g. "Find deals with healthcare companies that we won, and summarize the products and features that were the most important. also search for the questions they asked and categorize them in a table"

E.g. "Prep me for a demo with Wordtune by finding the key points from our last meeting relating to use cases, pain points, and potential blockers. Give me some conversation starters"

### Handoffs
Prepare for handoffs between team members. Paige can help you quickly get up to speed on a deal or account.

E.g. "Search our deal with Yodo with opportunities for upsell and account growth, then search for potential churn risks we identified. Then generate a handoff report for the account managers."
