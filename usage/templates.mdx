Templates are reusable versions of your sales collateral. These are typically proposals, sales decks, checklists, and other documents that are used frequently in your sales process. 

DealPage uses variables to customize your templates and make them personalizable. These variables are dynamically filled with real data from your deals, contacts, and content library for each deal.

## Creating a Template
Navigate to the Templates tab and upload any .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx file. You can also create templates from scratch. 
You will replace content in your Template with variables and instructions for Paige to use when filling them in.

## Variables
There are 5 types of variables, each that uses a curly-brace syntax. An example is `{customer.name}` Paige uses your custom instructions, and optional 'default values' to iterate through each variable in a document and fill it out.

You should think of the instructions for each variable as prompts - the more specific you are, the better the output will be. 
For example, you can ask Paige to write 3 bullet points about a customer's pain points, or to fill in a table with the customer's contact information.

Default values are used as fallbacks if Paige can't find any deal-specific content to personalize the template.

### Text

These will be replaced with plain text. Useful for titles, address lines, introductions, recaps, etc. 

```
{customer_name}
```

### Images

These start with a `%` and will be replaced with an image. Images from your content library will be searched, as well as the images from the deal such as contact pictures and client logos.

```
{%customer_logo}
```

### Loops

Loop variables have the below syntax will be replaced with a dynamic number of items. Useful for order forms, dyanmic tables, and lists.

```
{#items}{item_name}{/items}
```

### Objects

Object variables have the `.` delimiter and are group related variables together, and are processed at the same time. Use this when you want related variables to be grouped and have related logic.

```
{customer.name}
{customer.address}
```

### HTML

HTML variables start with a `~~` are replaced with rich text from the model. Useful for longer sections of a proposal where you need rich text formatting.

```
{~~content}
```
