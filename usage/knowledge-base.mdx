### Integrations
See the integrations page for up-to-date info on our supported integrations.

### Folders
Folders are organizational units. Folders only affect search results through permissions - so they're useful to segment content by role or team if you don't want everyone to have access.

### Summaries
Summaries are automatically generated when you upload any content. You can edit these summaries if needed. Summaries are used to help narrow down search results.

### Labels
Labels are DealPage defaults which are suggested by Paige when documents are uploaded. Labels are implicitly used by Paige to rank search results, but can also be used to explicitly filter search results.

### Product Labels
Product Labels are user configured labels. These are typically used to segment different products (e.g. Self-Hosted vs Cloud offerings). The main benefit of Product Labels is explicit filtering during various DealPage Workflows (e.g. Security Questionnaire for your Self-Hosted product). 

### Reviews
Every document and Verified Answer has an owner and a review policy. Review policies tell us when you want us to remind a document owner to verify that content is up-to-date. These notifications are sent to email by default but can also be received in Slack.

### Analytics
When you share content via DealPage, we collect insights into viewers, questions, page view time, and more.


## Collections
Collections are a set of documents that can be shared with a single link. Collections are a great way to organize training modules, playbooks, and other resources for your SEs and other sales team members. 

When shared, you'll get detailed analytics including the time viewed per document, most common questions, and
how far each user made it through the collection. You set up collections by simply selecting content from your knowledge base, writing a brief introduction, and some example questions for viewers to ask. 

They'll have the option of chatting with the Collection Owner, or with the AI to get instant answers. 

Example Collections:
1. Training for New Product X
2. New SE Onboarding
3. Competitor Landscape and Battlecards

## Verified Answers

Verified answers are custom question/answer pairs that are used to tune the AI model. The model will prioritize matching answers in Verified Answers before
sources from your content library.
