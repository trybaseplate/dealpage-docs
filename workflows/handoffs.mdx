## Overview

The average sales team spends tons of time syncing up on accounts, Slack messaging teammates and digging through emails to find the latest information. Paige helps streamline information sharing when passing leads from sales to presales to postsales.

This protects against information loss, ensures a smooth handoff, and helps reps close deals faster.

Handoffs can be conducted via Chat - by asking Paige to summarize the deal, answer specific questions, or even by asking her to catch up a new team member.
Handoffs can also be conducted using a handoff Template - the template contains a pre-defined set of questions and answers that can be used to ensure a consistent handoff process.

## Examples
<Tip> Use prompts like these to begin your handoff </Tip>
```
Summarize the deal with Acme Corp. Did we discuss budget with them?
```
```
Search our deal with Yodo with opportunities for upsell and account growth,
then search for potential churn risks we identified. 
Then generate a handoff report for account managers
```
```
Catch up our new team member on the deal with Acme Corp. What are the key points they should know?
```

## Pre-requisites

1. To conduct handoffs via Chat, you just need to make sure Paige has access to the right data (e.g. CRM and meeting transcripts).
2. To conduct handoffs via a Template, you need to create a handoff template in the DealPage web app.

## How it works via Chat

1. Create a chat session or open the chat modal using "cmd + k".
2. Enter your query. Use one of the examples above or create your own! Ensure that you are mentioning the Deal in your query to help Paige look in the right place.
3. Feel free to ask follow-up questions.

## How it works via Template

1. Create a handoff template in the DealPage web app. Add a variable for each topic you want the handoff document to cover. E.g. `{pain_points}`
2. Add instructions for each variable. E.g. "Summarize the pain points for this account in 3 bullet points"
3. When you want to generate a handoff document, select the "Document" workflow inside of your Deal. Choose the handoff Template and click "Customize." Paige will generate a handoff document based on the template and the data in the Deal.

## Tips

1. Connect your CRM to have Deals/Opportunities automatically sync with DealPage. We'll index all of the standard CRM objects and properties. If we miss a field that you need, just let us know at support@dealpage.ai
2. Meeting transcripts and meeting notes have a ton of important context regarding deals, so try to upload those whenever possible.
3. If you have email threads with important context, you can import them to a Deal to have them indexed.
