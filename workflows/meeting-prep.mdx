## Pre-requisites
None - just ensure Paige has access to the data you want her to review!

## How it Works
1. Create a chat session or open the chat modal using "cmd + k". 
2. Enter your query. Use one of the examples above or create your own! 
3. Paige will first select Deals based on the criteria in your query. Paige can select deals based on the following criteria:
    - Recency
    - Deal Size
    - Deal Stage
    - Customer Description
    - Revenue
    - Number of employees
4. After selecting a set of Deals, Paige will execute a set of queries on each Deal to answer your questions.
5. Paige will then summarize the results in a format according to your query, for example a table.
