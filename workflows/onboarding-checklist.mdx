## Overview
Generate personalized onboarding packets using examples from your [Knowledge Base](../usage/knowledge-base), and personalized using information from a [Deal](../usage/deals).

Onboarding documents are typically created using the Customize Template workflow. This allows you to leverage AI-generated personalized content directly inside your .xlsx spreadsheets, .pptx presentations, or .docx documents.

### How it Works
1. **Create a Template**: Upload an onboarding document as a Template in the Templates tab (or start from scratch). See more details in the [Templates](../usage/templates) section. It's helpful to use loop variables to dynamically generate multiple rows for action items.
2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose the Onboarding Template you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using information from your Deal and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format such as Powerpoint, or PDF.

### Tips
1. **Provide examples and detailed instructions**: The better the instructions in your Template, the more accurate the draft response will be.
