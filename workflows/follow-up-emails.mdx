## Overview
Follow-up emails are crucial to moving deals forward and making sure prospects have the right information at the right time. However, drafting these emails can be time-consuming and inefficient.

DealPage helps you draft timely, personalized, and relevant follow-up emails with the right content shared. You can share content from your sales content library, track engagement, and get deeper insights into buyer behavior.

## The Problem
Sales reps and AE default behavior:
1. Downloading content to desktop and sharing untracked attachments
2. Copying and pasting from previous emails or templates

This leads to low engagement from prospects, lack of insights into buyer behavior, and lower win rates.

3. **Deeper Insights**: Sales reps can more easily share content and track engagement, leading to more data on what content is working and buyer behavior.

## How it works
1. **Enable Link Sharing**: Enable link sharing from the dropdown menu on any document. You should see a clickable link icon on the document card for easy access.
2. **Share Content**: You can copy links manually and write your emails, or kick off a "Email Drafting" workflow from the DealPage Chrome Extension
3. **Email Drafting**: In Gmail, the DealPage Chrome Extension will allow you to select content to share, edit the custom instructions, and provide context from which the AI will derive next steps (e.g. meeting transcripts). Click "Draft" and you'll get a complete, context-aware, personalized email with the right content shared. We automatically map the email address to your deals.

## Tips

2. **Personalize**: Configure the content viewer with your logo and preferences. Add a personalized note to the content viewer to boost engagement.
3. **Collections**: Create collections of related content to share with prospects and guide them through specific journeys. You can share collections directly from the DealPage Chrome Extension.
