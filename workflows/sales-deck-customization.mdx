## Overview
Generate personalized Sales Decks using context from your [Knowledge Base](../usage/knowledge-base), and personalized using information about your audience from the [Deal](../usage/deals).

Sales Decks are created using the Customize Template workflow. This allows you to leverage AI-generated personalized content directly inside your Powerpoint presentations.

### How it Works
1. **Create a Template**: Upload a Sales Deck as a Template in the Templates tab (or start from scratch). See more details in the [Templates](../usage/templates) section.
2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose the Sales Deck you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using information from your Deal and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format such as Powerpoint, or PDF.

### Tips
1. **Provide examples and detailed instructions**: The better the instructions in your Template, the more accurate the draft response will be.
