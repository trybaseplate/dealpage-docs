## Overview
RFP responses are a critical source of revenue for many organizations, especially those that sell to the government or other large organizations. However, the process of responding to RFPs is time-consuming and expensive. DealPage uses AI to analyze RFPs and generate a first draft response in minutes, saving time and money for organizations.

## The Problem
RFP responses are often time-consuming, repetitive, and expensive. Organizations spend hours or even days writing responses to RFPs, only to find that they are rejected or that they have to start over from scratch. This is a waste of time and money, and can be frustrating for organizations that rely on RFPs for revenue.
Teams that work on RFPs are often copy-pasting, making slight modifications, and reusing content from previous RFPs. This is a time-consuming process that can lead to errors and inconsistencies in the final response. In addition, RFP responses are often written by multiple people, which can lead to inconsistencies in tone, style, and content.
