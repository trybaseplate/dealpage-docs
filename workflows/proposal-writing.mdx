## Overview
Generate personalized proposals using context from your [Knowledge Base](../usage/knowledge-base), and personalized using information about your audience from the [Deal](../usage/deals).

There are 2 ways to generate proposals in DealPage:
1. **[Customize Templates](../workflows/content-generation#template-customization)**: Fill out a reusable Proposal Template in .pptx or .docx using pre-defined variables for new deals quickly and accurately.
2. **[Custom Content](../workflows/content-generation#custom-content-generation)**: Generate net new proposal in Markdown. Edit in DealPage and then export into a designed document.

### How it Works
1. **Create a Template**: Upload a proposal and add variables to turn it into a Template in the Templates tab. See more details in the [Templates](../usage/templates) section.
2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose the proposal Template template you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using Deal Context and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format, such as Word, Powerpoint, or PDF. Present during meetings or share via email.

### Tips
1. **Provide examples and detailed instructions**: The better the instructions in your Template, the more accurate the draft response will be.

## Custom Content Generation
Useful for generating something highly customized from a prompt and custom outline.

### How it works
1. **Workflow Input**: Choose an existing outline template or create a new one. Provide a prompt that describes the document you want Paige to write. E.g. "Create a proposal focused on the expected benefits of our Slack features"
2. **Paige's [Chain of Thought](../how-it-works/completing-workflows#chain-of-thought)**: Paige will plan her response by asking herself a series of questions. For example, she might ask herself about the benefits of Slack, the prospect's pain points, and the pricing model.
3. **Draft**: Paige will draft the document using the results of the planning stage and your instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed in the [AI Document Editor](../usage/documents#ai-document-editor).
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into one of your branded templates or in a desired format, such as Word or Powerpoint.
