## Overview
Sales teams with repeatable processes often use the same sales decks, proposals, quotes, and other collateral to close deals. These templates are designed to be customized for each new deal, but the process can be time-consuming and error-prone. DealPage helps sales teams fill out their reusable templates for new deals quickly and accurately.

## The Problem
Filling out templates with accurate and personalized information for each new deal is time-consuming and error-prone. Sales teams often have to copy and paste information from various sources, such as CRM systems, spreadsheets, and documents, into the template. This process can take hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the template and the amount of information that needs to be filled out.

2. **Improve quality**: DealPage helps maintain accuracy, consistency, and personalization of sales collateral. 
3. **Increase win rate**: DealPage allows organizations to more deeply personalize their sales collateral, which can help them stand out from the competition and win more deals.

1. **Create a Template**: Upload and edit your Templates in the Templates tab. See more details in the [Templates](../concepts/templates) section.
2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose which template you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using Deal Context and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format, such as Word, Powerpoint, or PDF. Present during meetings or share via email.

## Tips
1. **Provide examples and detailed instructions**: The better the instructions in your Template, the more accurate the draft response will be.
