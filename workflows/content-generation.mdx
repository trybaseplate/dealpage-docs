## Overview
Occasionally, it can be helpful to generate net new content for a deal. This could be a proposal, a statement of work, or a support document. DealPage helps you generate personalized content quickly and easily.

This content can be customized, and is always generated using factual context from your knowledge base and information about your audience.

## Benefits of DealPage
1. **Save time and money**: DealPage cuts 90% of customization time.
2. **Improve quality**: DealPage helps maintain accuracy, consistency, and personalization of sales collateral. 
3. **Increase win rate**: DealPage allows organizations to more deeply personalize their sales collateral, which can help them stand out from the competition and win more deals.

## How it works
1. **Create a Template**: Upload and edit your Templates in the Templates tab. See more details in the [Templates](../concepts/templates) section.
2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose which template you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using Deal Context and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format, such as Word, Powerpoint, or PDF. Present during meetings or share via email.

## Tips
1. **Provide examples and detailed instructions**: The better the instructions in your Template, the more accurate the draft response will be.
