## Overview
Paige can help teams generate personalized content for their prospects and customers. Content is generated using examples and factual context from your [Knowledge Base](../usage/knowledge-base), and personalized using information about your audience from the [Deal](../usage/deals).

There are 2 types of content generation workflows in DealPage:
1. **[Custom Content](../workflows/content-generation#custom-content-generation)**: Generate net new content for a deal, such as a proposal, onboarding checklist, or support document.
2. **[Customize Templates](../workflows/content-generation#template-customization)**: Fill out reusable templates using pre-defined variables for new deals quickly and accurately.

## Custom Content Generation
This workflow is used to create highly customized sales content like proposals, onboarding documents, or support articles. It is completely customizeable and can be used for any document.

### Benefits
1. **Save time**: DealPage cuts time-to-draft by 99%. All it takes is a prompt and an outline to get started. 
2. **Improve quality**: Maintain high levels of accuracy, consistency, and personalization. 
3. **More wins**: Make it easy for your team to create more relevant content for every prospect, helping you stand out from the crowd

### How it works
1. **Workflow Input**: Choose an existing outline template or create a new one. Provide a prompt that describes the document you want Paige to write. E.g. "Create a proposal focused on the expected benefits of our Slack features"
2. **Paige's [Chain of Thought](../how-it-works/completing-workflows#chain-of-thought)**: Paige will plan her response by asking herself a series of questions. For example, she might ask herself about the benefits of Slack, the prospect's pain points, and the pricing model.
3. **Draft**: Paige will draft the document using the results of the planning stage and your instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed in the [AI Document Editor](../usage/documents#ai-document-editor).
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into one of your branded templates or in a desired format, such as Word or Powerpoint.


## Template Customization
Sales teams with repeatable processes often use the same sales decks, proposals, quotes, and other collateral to close deals. These templates are designed to be customized for each new deal, but the process can be time-consuming and error-prone. DealPage helps sales teams fill out their reusable templates for new deals quickly and accurately.

2. **Customize with Deal Context**: Choose Customize a Template from a Deal's Action Menu. Then choose which template you'd like to customize. 
3. **Draft**: DealPage will automatically fill out the template using Deal Context and your Template's instructions. Review and edit the draft response as needed.
4. **Finalize Response**: Finalize the response and export it into the desired format, such as Word, Powerpoint, or PDF. Present during meetings or share via email.

### Tips
