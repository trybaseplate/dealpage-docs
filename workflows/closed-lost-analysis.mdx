Search our last 5 recently lost deal and find out why we lost.
Add this to a table that maps the reasons to the amount of revenue lost.
Write a summary of the findings in a shareable email.

Search through the meeting transcripts in our lost deals,

## Pre-requisites
None - just ensure Paige has access to the data you want her to review!

## How it Works
1. Create a chat session or open the chat modal using "cmd + k". 
2. Enter your query. Use one of the examples above or create your own! 
3. Paige will first select Deals based on the criteria in your query. Paige can select deals based on the following criteria:
    - Recency
    - Deal Size
    - Deal Stage
    - Customer Description
    - Revenue
    - Number of employees
4. After selecting a set of Deals, Paige will execute a set of queries on each Deal to answer your questions. She will filter by the criteria you specify, for example, looking inside meeting transcripts.
5. Paige will then look in your product roadmap to identify delivery dates and add them to the table. 
6. Paige will then summarize the results in a format according to your query, for example a table.
