## The Problem
Sales Content Libraries are an important part of the sales process. They provide sales reps with the right content to share with prospects and tools for tracking engagement. 

However, sharing content from traditional libraries can be time-consuming and inefficient. Users need to go to the library, search for content, copy links, and then write and format into emails or messages.

The content shared, even when done properly, is static and not personalized.

## How it works
