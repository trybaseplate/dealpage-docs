## Overview
Security Questionnaires come in a variety of formats - spreadsheet, online form, document, etc. DealPage provides tools to respond to any questionnaire in seconds with AI.

## Benefits of DealPage
1. **Respond faster**: DealPage cuts 90% of response time.
2. **Improve quality**: DealPage helps maintain accuracy, consistency, and personalization of SQ responses. 

## How it works (File Upload)
1. **Upload File**: Upload an entire SQ in nearly any format, including PDF, Word, and Excel. You will be redirected to a spreadsheet that contains the extracted questions from the file you uploaded. Different ‘sheets’ can be accessed using the navigation at the bottom of the table. You have the option to edit the questions as you see fit, but this is usually unnecessary.

2. **Configure Spreadsheet**: Columns can be configured to 4 basic types - Text, Select, File Link, and Question. 
    1. Text: the model will use the column name and answer style (selected in the next step) to generate text
    2. Select: the model will select from pre-configured options (e.g. Yes / No / Other)
    3. File Link: the model will input a shareable link to source content from your knowledge base (e.g. SOC 2 Certification or security policies)
    4. Question: an input column that contains the question the model needs to answer. It is required to have at least ‘Question’ type column to generate responses

3. **Auto-Fill**: When you are ready to fill out the questionnaire, hit “Auto-fill” at the top of the table. This will complete selected rows and columns, or the entire spreadsheet based on your specification. You will have the option of selecting between 3 answer styles.
Review the first draft response and make any necessary changes with the help of AI. Add or remove content, highlight to ask AI to edit the tone and style, and ensure that the response is accurate and complete.

4. **Finalize Response**: You can click on a question to see the sources used to answer. Currently, answers that Paige cannot find an answer to will be left blank. Finalize the response and export it into your template in the desired format, such as Word, PDF, or Excel.
