## Workflows
Most workflows are completed directly in Chat, but some have dedicated screens and interfaces in the DealPage App (Business Plan only). For examples of common workflows and how to achieve them, see the Workflows section of the documentation. 

### Planning
For complex tasks (like [writing a proposal](../workflows/content-generation)) Paige will plan a set of intermediate steps before executing anything. 

### Chain of Thought
Paige will often answer a set of questions for herself before starting on a complex task. For example, when asked to write a proposal, she will usually refresh herself on your value proposition, the customer's pain points, any pricing that you've discussed, etc.

### Search
Paige's favorite tool is search. It helps her answer questions for herself, find examples, and more. She executes various types of search at every step in DealPage Workflows.


## FAQ

### Do documents created by Paige match our brand's style?
* Paige fetches examples of similar content from your Knowledge Base when writing documents. She won't always match your style if you don't have good examples, so we recommend using her outputs as first drafts.

### What types of workflows can I complete with Paige?
* Explicit workflows are [Emails](../workflows/emails) (respond or compose), [Documents](../workflows/content-generation) (generate or customize), and Respond ([spreadsheet](../workflows/sq-responses) or [RFP](../workflows/rfp-responses)).
* You can ask Paige to complete a variety of other tasks via chat, much like ChatGPT. These will not have the same guarantees as explicit workflows.

### Can I edit or customize the intermediate steps of a workflow?
* Usually! We want to make these intermediate steps more visible to users and configurable. When possible, we show these steps and allow users to change them, giving much more control over outputs.
